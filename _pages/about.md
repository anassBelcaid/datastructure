**Algorithms** and **Data structures** lie at the heart of the intersection
between the beauty of theory and the excitement of cutting-edge technology. One
can say that if the body of the advancements in computation is hardware, then
the mind is certainly the study of algorithms and data structures. Many of the
recent advances in technology have come to life thanks to the effective use of
computing resources to solve problems, and this is often due to the effective
development and clever use of data structures.

Upon completion of this course, you should be able to 

- Confidently apply classical paradigms to solve problems.
- Identify and optimize the complexity of your algorithms.
- Choose the best data structure for you problem.
